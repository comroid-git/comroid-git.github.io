<h2>General Data Privacy Notice</h2>
<p> We at comroid take much pride in our projects. We value and respect our users and their privacy, and thus we never
    collect any user-related data that is not necessary for a process to run. We also refuse to collaborate with
    advertising solutions that store more data than necessary to advertise.</p>
<p> Application side data storage happens in JSON or XML format, where access tokens are stored unencrypted to allow
    editing of raw config files. On the server side, all user data is stored in this same format, within server
    directories that can only be accessed by comroid staff. </p>
<p> Authorizing tokens are never stored by us on the Application side. If a token can be used to obtain additional
    authorization scopes, you as the user will be required to input the token each time. </p>

<h3>Discord-related Notice</h3>
<p> All Discord-related Products built by comroid attempt to strictly enforce <a
        onclick="window.open('https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal')">Discord Terms of Service</a> naturally. </p>
<p> Discord bots by third parties that use the CrystalShard library are not included in this statement; please refer to
    their respective creator's privacy notice. </p>
